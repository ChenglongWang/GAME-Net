- `BM_dataset.ipynb`: Evaluate GNN performance compared to DFT for the adsorption energy of the samples in the BM-dataset.
- `train_GNN.ipynb`: Perform a model training step by step, following exactly the same procedure implemented in the script `train_GNN.py`.
- `Graph_Conversion_Analysis_GNN.ipynb`: Analysis of the bad representations when converting DFT geometries of the FG-dataset to graphs.
- `ETOT_BMfamily.ipynb`: Evaluate GNN performance compared to DFT for the ground state energy of the samples of the specific family in the BM-dataset.
