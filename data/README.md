# Data directory

Here all the data used in this work are stored. 

- `FG_dataset` stands for "functional groups" dataset and includes the adsorption configurations that have been used to train the GNN models.

- `BM_dataset` includes "big molecules" of industrial interest (biomass, plastics and polyurethanes). It is used for testing the GNN performance in extrapolation mode. For each family of molecules, 5 representative molecules have been considered adsorbed on two metal catalysts, based on the specific application.
